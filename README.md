# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The project is about an ecommerce database, the challenge is to import the data(csv files) to pgadmin,and get useful insights from the data we have available.

## Process
### Import the csv files to pgadmin to create the tables
### Organize and clean and structure the data for analysis

## Results
After some cleaning process , we got to a point where we could make some sense of the data and run some queries to get insights, answer questions.

## Challenges 
There were many challenges including empty columns from tables, duplicates.

## Future Goals
If I have more time I would attempt to clean the data for further investigation, and find ways to create conncetions between the tables to get more insights.
